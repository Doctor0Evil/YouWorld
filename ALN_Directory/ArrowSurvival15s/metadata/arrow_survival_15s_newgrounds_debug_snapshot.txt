  title: "Arrow Survival: 15 Seconds"
  variant: "Web/HTML5 demo (Newgrounds iframe build)"
  author: "Low Pixel Byte"
  genre: ["Platformer", "Action", "Arcade"]
  tags: ["2D", "Pixel Art", "Arrow", "Bow", "HTML5", "GDevelop"]
  engine:
    name: "GDevelop"
    export_target: "HTML5 (Web)"
  core_concept:
    loop: "Survive 15 seconds per level by dodging hazards and managing your own ricocheting arrows."
    key_mechanic: "Magic arrow projectiles with deliberately chaotic ricochet paths that can create temporary safe or dead zones."
  platform_context:
    primary_portal: "Newgrounds HTML5 iframe"
    mirrored_builds:
      - "Itch.io Web/HTML5 demo"
      - "Legacy PC listing on third‑party databases"
design_observations:
  projectile_system:
    type: "Magic arrow, non-realistic physics"
    behavior:
      - "Arrows glow and behave as non-physical projectiles, justifying non-classical bounces."
      - "Ricochet angles are intentionally non-deterministic in some edge cases to prevent trivial safe-spot exploitation."
      - "Arrows may enter long-lived bounce loops when trapped in geometry gaps, reducing threat in local zones."
    inferred_risks:
      - "Edge-corner ricochets can feel 'random' but are aligned with the intended challenge profile."
      - "Tilemap or collider seams can generate situations where projectile threat is effectively removed from the player’s reachable area."
  level_geometry:
    structure:
      - "Tile/texture-based platforms with potential micro-gaps between tiles or collider bounds."
      - "Platforms and walls form arrow bounce corridors and traps that can be exploited by skilled players."
    known_issues_like:
      - "Arrows getting stuck in micro-gaps and bouncing indefinitely out-of-threat."
      - "Visual-collider desync creating deceptive 'safe' or 'dead' spaces."
debug_visibility_limits:
  public_artifacts:
    - "Gameplay teaser video (Web/HTML5 demo)."
    - "Itch.io store metadata: engine, platform, genre, tags, and marketing description."
    - "Newgrounds portal page: iframe-embedded HTML5 game, comments, and thumbnails."
    - "Announcement / dev post with basic description and links."
  not_exposed_publicly:
    - "Internal debug logs or trace overlays from the Newgrounds build."
    - "Collision maps, hitbox visualizers, or physics-debug layers."
    - "Source code, symbol files, or engine-level profiling hooks."
    - "Developer console, debug commands, or API endpoints dedicated to debugging."
  compliance_notes:
    - "Any deep debug must be performed locally via browser DevTools, respecting portal TOS and copyright."
    - "No decompilation or unauthorized scraping of proprietary game logic is assumed in this snapshot."
local_debug_strategy:
  requirement: "Treat browser DevTools + YouWorld as the primary inspection surface; do not rely on Newgrounds for debug APIs."
  steps:
    - "Load the Newgrounds portal item hosting the HTML5 demo in a Chromium-based browser."
    - "Open DevTools, focus on Network, Console, and Performance/Timeline panels while the iframe game runs."
    - "Identify the iframe that hosts the game (origin likely from a Newgrounds or external CDN domain)."
    - "Capture:
         * All game asset requests (HTML, JS, JSON, WASM, images, audio).
         * Console logs, warnings, errors, and uncaught exceptions.
         * Frame-rate and main-thread blocking events around heavy arrow activity."
    - "Optionally host a local copy of the HTML5 build (if provided by dev) to enable more intrusive instrumentation."
analysis_targets:
  1:
    name: "Arrow ricochet predictability"
    goal: "Characterize how often ricochet angles deviate from classical reflection rules at tile corners."
    method:
      - "Record video plus DevTools performance timeline during repeated shots into walls and corners."
      - "Log approximate entry and exit angles (via visual frame stepping) for series of bounces."
      - "Cluster events into 'expected square bounce' vs 'chaotic redirect' to quantify intended chaos."
  2:
    name: "Safe-spot and dead-zone formation"
    goal: "Detect when arrows become harmless because they are trapped away from the player’s reachable area."
    method:
      - "Identify cases where an arrow is confined to a loop that does not intersect the player’s reachable space."
      - "Tag time intervals where no projectile intersects the player’s potential path despite being active."
      - "Use these findings as inputs for level-design feedback or ALN-based auto-tuning (if working with the dev)."
  3:
    name: "Geometry gaps and collider seams"
    goal: "Locate platform boundaries that consistently trap arrows or cause visual/physics mismatches."
    method:
      - "Observe repeated arrow entrapment at specific pixel coordinates or tiles."
      - "Correlate visible texture seams with suspected collider edges."
      - "If working with a local build, overlay a simple collider-visualization layer in-engine to confirm."
youworld_integration_hooks:
  debug_role: "Use YouWorld as a trace hub and visualization layer for browser/game telemetry."
  ingestion:
    devtools_bridge:
      description: "Browser extension or external CDP client that forwards DevTools events into YouWorld."
      channels:
        - "Network: resource loads for Newgrounds portal and game iframe."
        - "Console: logs, warnings, errors from game JavaScript."
        - "Runtime: uncaught exceptions, stack traces, and custom debug messages."
        - "Page/DOM: iframe structure, main canvas identification."
      tagging:
        - "worldId: stable identifier representing the Arrow Survival Newgrounds world instance."
        - "frameContext: 'newgrounds-portal-shell', 'game-iframe', 'third-party-ad-or-analytics'."
  schema_binding:
    debug_trace_schema_ref: "/schemas/DebugTrace"
    mapped_fields:
      - "source: browser, cdp, extension-content-script"
      - "type: network | console | runtime-error | performance | canvas-probe"
      - "url: full request URI for network-type events."
      - "frameId: identifier for source frame (portal shell vs game iframe)."
      - "worldContext: high-level label like 'Newgrounds iframe' or 'ArrowSurvival15s-canvas'."
      - "stackTrace: symbolized where possible for runtime/console events."
      - "timing: timestamps and durations normalized to world clock."
  api_endpoints:

          - "?type=console&level=error"
          - "?type=canvas-probe&tag=collision"
      usage:
        - "Drive ALN-based visual dashboards that show spike zones for errors or long frame times."
        - "Feed a 'debug-world' where each request, error, or collision trace is rendered as a spatial node."

canvas_and_collision_inference:
  limitations:
    - "Browsers do not expose engine-level collision maps directly."
    - "Collision must be inferred from game-level instrumentation or visual analysis."
  non-invasive_techniques:
    - "Hook requestAnimationFrame in an injected script to periodically sample game-visible state, if accessible."
    - "Register window.onerror and 'error' event listeners to capture unhandled exceptions and resource failures."
    - "Mirror console.log / console.error calls that the dev may already use for ad-hoc collision or state debugging."
  cooperative_instrumentation_path:
    requires_dev_support: true
    actions:
      - "Add a lightweight debug flag in the game JS (e.g., ?debug=1) that enables:
           * Logging of collision events (entities, positions, bounds).
           * Reporting of arrow spawn/despawn events and bounce counts.
           * Periodic dumps of player position and active hazard count."
      - "Route these debug logs to console or a custom window.debugChannel object."
      - "Let YouWorld’s devtools-relay subscribe and ingest them into the DebugTrace schema."
security_and_ethics:
  scope:
    - "Only use publicly visible builds and browser APIs."
    - "Avoid reverse engineering beyond standard DevTools inspection used by web developers."
    - "Respect copyright and intellectual property; treat all traces as observational data for debugging."
  recommended_workflow:
    - "If deeper engine-level insight is needed, request a dedicated debug build or documentation from Low Pixel Byte."
    - "Document all instrumentation steps clearly in ALN so they remain auditable and repeatable."
status:
  snapshot_intent: "Serve as a non-invasive, legally-safe debug-info baseline for Arrow Survival: 15 Seconds (Newgrounds demo) within YouWorld/ALN workflows."
  next_steps:
    - "Implement YouWorld browser devtools-relay client."
    - "Create a dedicated worldId for the Arrow Survival Newgrounds demo."
    - "Record at least 2–3 sessions focused on ricochet behavior, safe spots, and geometry gaps for later ALN analysis."
